## Mini amazone Clone App 

 The main main objective was the usage of firebase cloud functions and the flexibility they offer when it comes to deals with sensitive data that with don't want our users to have access to; such as APl keys, database URI, etc.  for frontend based applications. 

## Tech stack used :
  * React framework for the app 
  * React Context API for the state management
  * Firebase for real-time database for user data storage
  * Stripe payement integration for checkout payement process
  * Firebase cloud functions : mainly to hide apis that have direct access to the project 
  * Firebase web app hosting
  
 I can not say it enough  the project is not aimed to be focused on |UI design and RWP
## Uses cases : 
  As a user I want to 
  * Browser products as a guest or loged user
  * add products to the basket as a guest or loged user
  * browser basket products
  * remove items from the basket 
  * login , logout and signup with a unique email
  * purchase product using the  universal stripe card validation for testing apis (alternate 42 all the places requiring card informations)
  * see products rating
